# Architectural Design Plan

## Objective
Outline the key components of the betting game application, including frontend, backend, blockchain integration, and their interactions.

## Key Components
- **Frontend:** Designed with React and Material UI, highlighting the user interface and experience.
- **Backend:** Utilizes Node.js and NestJs for handling bets, user interactions, and communication with the blockchain.
- **Blockchain:** Incorporates Bitcoin.js for managing bets on the blockchain, including recording and verification.
- **Visualization:** Details the onchain and offchain visualization of bets and predictions.

## Interaction Flow
Describe how the user's bets are submitted through the frontend, processed by the backend, recorded on the blockchain, and how results are visualized.

## Challenges and Considerations
Discuss potential challenges in implementing this architecture and propose solutions.

This document serves as a blueprint for the development and integration of the components necessary for the betting game application.
