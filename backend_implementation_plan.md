# Backend Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement the backend for a betting game that records bets on the Bitcoin blockchain, utilizing BitcoinJS for the interactions.

## Libraries and Technologies
- Node.js (Backend runtime)
- TypeScript (Development language)
- Bitcoin.js (Blockchain interactions)

## Steps
1. Set up a new Node.js project with TypeScript.
2. Integrate the BitcoinJS library into the project.
3. Develop foundational backend functionalities, including:
   - Wallet creation and management
   - Recording bets as Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions
   - Handling transactions and blockchain interactions

## Expected Challenges
- Ensuring secure handling of wallet transactions
- Adapting BitcoinJS for specific requirements of bet recording

## Milestones
- Setup completed (Node.js project with TypeScript and BitcoinJS)
- Prototype of bet recording mechanism
- Secure transaction handling

This plan outlines the initial steps towards building the backend for our blockchain-based betting game.
