Designed to engage the cryptocurrency community, users submit their halving predictions through a user-friendly interface. Each prediction is conveniently entered in a human-readable format, which the system then converts into Unix timestamps. To maintain exclusivity and manageability, the game is limited to a total of 5,000 inscriptions, each uniquely recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. This limitation not only enhances the value of each bet but also ensures the game remains scalable and efficient.\n\nAs a distinctive feature, \"SatoshisSteaks\" integrates digital art generation, where each bet inscription is accompanied by a piece of digital art. This art dynamically represents the user's guess, visualizing the predicted timestamp in an engaging and artistic manner. The evolving nature of this art adds an aesthetic appeal to the game, making each bet a collectible item. The art evolves as more predictions are made, reflecting the collective sentiment and anticipation of the Bitcoin community towards the halving event.\n\nThe game is meticulously designed to be legally compliant, with thorough consideration given to the varying regulations surrounding online betting and cryptocurrency transactions. A comprehensive testing plan is in place to ensure the game's functionality aligns with technical requirements and legal standards. This includes testing the accuracy of timestamp conversions, blockchain inscription integrity, and the reliability of the art generation process. \"SatoshisSteaks\" aims to provide a secure, transparent, and entertaining platform for crypto enthusiasts to engage with one of the most significant events in the cryptocurrency world.
