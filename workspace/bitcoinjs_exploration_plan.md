# Bitcoin.js Exploration Plan

## Objective
To experiment with Bitcoin.js code examples to gain practical insights into creating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, specifically for integrating into 'SatoshisSteaks' game.

## Steps
1. Review the Bitcoin.js library documentation for transaction creation and management.
2. Execute code examples relevant to creating Bitcoin transactions.
3. Adapt the learned concepts to the context of recording bets on the blockchain for 'SatoshisSteaks'.

## Goals
- Understand the technical capabilities and limitations of Bitcoin.js.
- Explore the feasibility of recording bets on the Bitcoin blockchain in a secure and efficient manner.

This exploration will inform the next steps in our development process.
