# Backend Logic for User Predictions

## Overview
This document outlines the planned approach for implementing the backend logic that handles user predictions in the 'SatoshisSteaks' game. Key aspects include prediction submission, timestamp conversion, and managing prediction records.

## Prediction Submission
- API endpoint for prediction submission.
- Input validation and error handling.

## Timestamp Conversion
- Convert human-readable dates to Unix timestamps.

## Managing Prediction Records
- Insertion of predictions into the PostgreSQL database.
- Ensuring unique entries per user to maintain exclusivity.

This implementation serves as the foundation for enabling users to engage with the game by making their halving event predictions.
