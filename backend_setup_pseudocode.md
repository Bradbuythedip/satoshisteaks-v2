# Backend Setup Pseudocode

Since the current environment does not support npm or Node.js, below is a pseudocode description of how the backend setup would ideally proceed if those tools were available.

## Step 1: Initialize Project
- Create a new directory for the backend project.
- Initialize a new Node.js project within this directory.

## Step 2: Setup TypeScript
- Install TypeScript as a development dependency.
- Initialize TypeScript configuration.

## Step 3: Install Bitcoin.js library
- Add the bitcoinjs-lib package to the project.

## Step 4: Basic Project Skeleton
- Create a src directory.
- Inside src, create an index.ts file as the entry point for the backend application.

This pseudocode outlines the initial steps that would be taken to set up the backend environment for our betting game application, focusing on project structure and key dependencies.
