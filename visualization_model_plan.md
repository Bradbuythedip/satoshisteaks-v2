# Visualization Model Plan

## Objective
The goal is to create a comprehensive plan for visualizing the ordinal collection of bets and the predictions on the Bitcoin halving.

## Components
- **Onchain Visualization:** Utilizing ordinal theory to represent each bet on the blockchain.
- **Offchain Visualization:** Designing interactive modules to display predictions and their closeness to the actual halving date.

## Implementation Thoughts
- Investigate current technologies that can bridge the data from the blockchain to a user-friendly interface.
- Consider the scalability of these visual tools to handle 10,000 pieces in the collection.

This document serves as an initial blueprint for the visualization aspects of the betting game.
